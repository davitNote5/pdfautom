It is by far the most common form of high blood pressure, affecting the majority of those who experience hypertension. It is also known as primary hypertension. As the heart pumps blood through the circulatory system, blood presses against the artery walls. High blood pressure occurs when the walls of the arteries exert a stronger oppositional force, which requires the heart to work harder to move blood through the body. This results in an increase in the pressure of blood in the arteries. There are a variety of methods for managing essential hypertension, including lifestyle changes and medication.
